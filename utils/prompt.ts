export const basePrompt = `Lord Shiva in his fierce Mahakal form performs the divine Tandav amid a cosmic battlefield. His eyes glow with overwhelming divine intensity; his matted hair (jata) whips and swirls through storm winds, with the sacred Ganga flowing gracefully from his locks. In his right hand, the Trishul (trident) gleams with celestial radiance; in his left, the damru beats thunderously, each strike sending visible ripples of power through the universe. Mount Kailash trembles in the distance, rivers appear to flow backward, and celestial beings look on in awe as the dance obliterates negativity and restores cosmic balance. The world ignites with spiritual electricity ? a majestic, fierce, transcendental scene of destruction and rebirth.`
